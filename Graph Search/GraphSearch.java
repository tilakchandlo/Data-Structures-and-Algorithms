 * Also, you do not have to run CheckStyle on this assignment.
 * But make it look pretty.  Pretty please. With a cherry on top.
 * 
 * If you don't know what to return for something, look at the JUnits.
 * They should tell you what they expect if null is passed in, etc.
 * If there's not a test case for it, then don't worry about it! :)
